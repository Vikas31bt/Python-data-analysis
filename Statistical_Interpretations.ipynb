    "Now that you have some stats tools under your belts, let's test and see how much you know! This assignment is meant to three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can you run some descriptive statistics?\n",
    "2. Can you pick the right test to answer the question of interest?\n",
    "3. Can you interpret what the result of your test means?\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will consist of both coding questions and multiple choice questions as well. Topics in the assignment may be directly from lectures/practicals or might encourage you to look for new functions to accomplish the goal. Please ensure to read the questions carefully and to copy variable names and file paths to ensure no typos. As the assignment will be using autograder, it will mark typos as incorrect, and no part marks will be rewarded ... you have been warned. Make sure you also load all the packages required for the functions you are using. You will periodically see blank cells, do not move them or try to delete them as these are the grading cells. As always if you have any questions feel free to post on the discussion board or email both Vicki \\([vickimengyuan.zhang@humber.ca](mailto:vickimengyuan.zhang@humber.ca)\\) and Yeshoda \\([yeshoda.harry\\-paul@humber.ca](mailto:yeshoda.harry-paul@humber.ca)\\).

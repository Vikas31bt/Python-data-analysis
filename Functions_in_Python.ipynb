    "# Creating Functions in Python  \n",

    "In this notebook, I will be showing you how we can create functions in Python. Recall the following from class:  \n",
    "1. Functions have a definition or name them using a `def` statement  \n",
    "2. The `def` statement ends with a colon (standard Python syntax)  \n",
    "3. The following lines of code are *indented* - which tells Python which code is a part of your function and which isn't  \n",
    "4. Functions have an input and an output  \n",
    "5. The output is denoted as the `return` value  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create some functions! Let's do the following tasks:  \n",
    "1. Create a function that takes in two points and returns the norm of the vector made by them  \n",
    "2. Create a function that takes in a string and tells us some information about it  "

    "# Getting started with GitHub  \n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a popular platform for version control and collaborative software development. In this handout, you'll get started with the basics of GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/).\n",
    "2. Click on \"Sign up\" in the upper-right corner.\n",
    "3. Follow the instructions to create your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Git on Your Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is the version control system that GitHub is built on. You need to install Git on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Windows: Download and install Git from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\n",
    "- For macOS: Git is pre-installed. If not, you can install it using Homebrew (`brew install git`).\n",
    "- For Linux: You can install Git through your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Ubuntu).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set Up Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal or command prompt and configure Git with your name and email:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Create a Repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "A repository (or \"repo\") is where your project and its files will live. Follow these steps to create a new repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to your GitHub account.\n",
    "2. Click the \"+\" sign in the upper-right corner and select \"New repository.\"\n",
    "3. Name your repository, add a description, and choose public or private.\n",
    "4. Initialize this repository with a README if you want to start with a README file.\n",
    "5. Click \"Create repository.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Clone Your Repository to Your Local Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you'll clone (download) the repository to your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the green \"Code\" button on your GitHub repository page.\n",
    "2. Copy the repository URL.\n",
    "3. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.\n",
    "4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.\n",
    "5. Run the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL you copied:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone <repository_url>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Make Changes Locally\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go into your local repository directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd your-repository-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new file or modify existing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Add and Commit Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the following commands to stage and commit your changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Your commit message\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Push Changes to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Push your changes to the GitHub repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Create a Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working with others, you'll typically create a pull request (PR) to propose changes to the main project. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Click on the \"Pull Requests\" tab.\n",
    "3. Click the \"New pull request\" button.\n",
    "4. Select the branch with your changes and the branch you want to merge into.\n",
    "5. Write a title and description for your pull request.\n",
    "6. Click the \"Create pull request\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 10: Review and Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "Your changes are now in a pull request. Collaborators can review your code, leave comments, and suggest changes. Once everything is good, someone with the necessary permissions can merge your changes into the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully created a GitHub repository, made changes, and collaborated using pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This handout covers the basics, and there's much more to learn as you become more comfortable with Git and GitHub.
